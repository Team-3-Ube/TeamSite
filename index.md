### What Is Voluntree?

Voluntree is a volunteer management system that helps match willing volunteers with nonprofits, and other organizations. Currently, there is no easy way for volunteers to find organizations that need their help. Voluntree aims to solve this problem by providing a platform for organizations to post their volunteer opportunities and for volunteers to find them. Voluntree is a web application that is accessible from any device with a web browser.

## Goals

Voluntree aims to provide the following features:
* Account Registration
* Volunteer Profile
* Organization Profile
* Volunteer Opportunities Posting
